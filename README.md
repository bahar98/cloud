Reasons for choosing these services: convi



chosen project: https://github.com/OmerFI/PyForum

Services: user, post, comment

Reasons for choosing these services: 1. user service because in this service we can create the jwt token that is required. 2. post service because in this service we will be communicating with both other services and aside from communication with the user service, in communication with the comment service we will be able to use gRPC calls which is one of the requirements of this phase. 3. This service, comment has been chosen because of very similiar reasons that the post service has been chosen, as well as the fact that post and comment services should be seperate entities so that they can be developed individually.
